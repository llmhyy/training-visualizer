# What is Time-Travelling Visualization?
Time-Travelling Visualization, a technique designed to visualize high-dimensional representations during the deep learning training process. In other words, our method is designed to transform the model training dynamics into an animation of canvas with colorful dots and territories.

# How to Use it?

## Pull Our Code
```
git clone https://github.com/code-philia/time-travelling-visualizer.git

- training_dynamic fold is for storing the dataset
- Vis fold is for training the visualization models
- visTool fold is the interactive visualization tool's backend and frontend

⚠️ Note that, the training_dynamic folder stores the training process and the target dataset. 


## Training Process Dataset (the training process of a model)


You can train your classification model and save the training dynamics. For information on the structure of the training dynamics directory and the config file format, refer to the the [dataset's readme document](./training_dynamic/README.md).

🍃 Training dynamics are also available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yvonne1123/training_dynamic) for you to download. 


# Environment Configuration
1. create conda environment
```
$ cd Vis
$ conda create -n visualizer python=3.7
$ (visualizer) conda activate visualizer
```

2. install pyTorch and CUDA
For setting up PyTorch on that conda environment, use the guidelines provided at [PyTorch's official local installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This guide will help you select the appropriate configuration based on your operating system, package manager, Python version, and CUDA version.

3. install requirements
```
$ (visualizer) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# evaluate subject model
```
$ (visualizer) pip install -r requirements.txt
$ (visualizer) python subject_model_eval.py
```
The trainig dynamic performance(testing accuracy and training accuracy) will be store in /training_dynamic/Model/subject_model_eval.json

# Train Your Time-Travelling Visualizer
```
$ cd Vis
$ conda activate visualizer
# proxy only
$ (visualizer) python proxy.py --epoch epoch_number(default 3) --content_path "dataset path"(default: /training_dynamic)

# the vis result will be store in /training_dynamic/Proxy/***.png
# the evaluation resulte wiil be store in /training_dynamic/Model/proxy_eval.json

# trustvis with AL
$ (visualizer)  python active_learning.py  --epoch num --content_path "dataset path"(default: /training_dynamic)

# the vis result will be store in /training_dynamic/Trust_al/***.png
# the evaluation resulte wiil be store in /training_dynamic/Model/trustvis_al_eval.json

```

# Run Your interactive Visualizer Tool
![Interactive Visualizer Tool](screenshot.png)
## Backend
```
$ cd /VisTool/Backend/server
$ conda activate visualizer
$ (visualizer) python server.py
```
you will see: 
```
* Serving Flask app 'server' (lazy loading)
* Environment: production
* Debug mode: off
* Running on http://localhost:5000
```

## Frontend (Option1:Accessing the Built Frontend)
The built version of our frontend interface is stored in the directory /VisTool/Frontend(BUILT). To access it, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the directory: /VisTool/Frontend(BUILT)
2. Open the file standalone.html in a web browser.
3. Enter the content_path (path to the training dynamic dataset, default is time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic) and the backend IP address and port (default is XX.XX.XXX:5000).
4. Click on the 'Login' button to start using the frontend.


## Frontend (Option2: build frontend yourself)

1. Download Bazel from [Bazel's official website](https://bazel.build/install) (version 3.2.0 recommended).
2. Verify the successful installation of Bazel by checking its version:
```
> bazel version
3.2.0
```
3. To run the frontend, use the following commands:
```
cd /VisTool/Frontend
bazel run tensorboard/projector:standalone
```
and you can see:
```
Closure Rules WebfilesServer
Listening on: http://XXX.XX.XXX:6006/
```
4. Access the frontend by opening http://XXX.XX.XXX:6006/ in your web browser.
5. Enter the content_path (path to the training dynamic dataset, default is time-travelling-visualizer/training_dynamic) and the backend IP address and port (default is XX.XX.XXX:5000).
6. Click on the 'Login' button to start using the frontend.
